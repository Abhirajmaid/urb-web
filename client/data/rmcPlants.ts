  content: [
    "Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) is a factory-made concrete that is manufactured in a batching plant according to a set recipe and then delivered to the construction site in a transit mixer truck. Unlike traditional on-site concrete mixing, RMC ensures consistent quality, precise mix proportions, and eliminates the need for on-site storage of raw materials.",
    "RMC is produced under controlled conditions using advanced batching systems, ensuring uniform quality and strength. The concrete is mixed in a central plant and transported to construction sites in specialized transit mixer trucks that keep the concrete in a workable state during transit.",
    "This modern approach to concrete production offers numerous advantages including better quality control, reduced wastage, faster construction, and environmental benefits through optimized material usage and reduced site pollution.",

    "Consistent quality and strength",
